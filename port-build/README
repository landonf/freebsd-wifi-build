This is a very simple, hackish package building framework for doing
the bare minimum I need to get packages into this environment.

It's .. hackish.  And yes, this file is just a set of notes so things
aren't forgotten.

* generating an mtree:

mtree -c -p /home/adrian/work/freebsd/head-embedded/pkgbuild/mips_ap/mips.mips/lua/staging/usr | mtree -C

.. trouble is, that mtree needs modifying (eg content=X, update uid/gid, etc)
to be accepted by tar.

So yes, the output of mtree isn't 100% compatible with the input
required by tar.

The output of tar mtree isn't 100% compatible out of the box with
the mtree format required by makefs.  Sigh.
